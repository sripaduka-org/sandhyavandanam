This site is an attempt to present the process and provide the resource to perform sandhyavandam by all who believe in sanatana dharma. This process was put together by Sripaduka (Sri Kolluru Avatara Sarma) after consulting with many seers and prominent thought leaders to empower those who beleive in sanatana dharma.

All the mistakes are mine and please send the comments/clarifications to saroja.seetarama@gmail.com
