Universe (Brahmāṃḍaṃ) and each living creature (Piṃḍāṃḍaṃ) look different but both are gross and subtle bodies of Sun, the Karma sākshi aṃtaryāmi! For both, he is glorified as the soul - " sūrya ātmā jagatastasthuṣaśca (सूर्य आत्मा जगतस्तस्थुषश्च)". No matter what kind of deformity or ailment (disease) occurs in the body, it is Surya who is the healer who protects us and drives us all the way. That’s why our great sages prescribed and ordered that Surya upasayana must be done daily at samdhya time ‘aharaha-ssaṃdhyā-mupāsīta’ ('अहरह स्संध्या मुपासीत').

This is the welfare message preached by Jagadguru in line with our Sanatana dharma followed by Rishis and Veda sāmpradaya. A boy who receives upanayana samskāram at a tender age of 5-years, does Saṃdhyopāsana three times every day, expresses his desire for universal welfare and peace in the world with the hymn - ' lokā ssamastā: sukhino bhavaṃtu! Oṃ śāṃti śśāṃti śśāṃti: (लोकास्समस्ताः सुखिनो भवंतु! ओं शांतिश्शांतिश्शांतिः)'. Even today one can find such brahmachari in orthodox Brahmin families. It is our responsibility to preserve such sacred tradition to which we belong.
