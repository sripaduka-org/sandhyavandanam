The highest truth and real purpose of Saṃdhyāvaṃdanam (Saṃdhyāvaṃdana paramārthaṃ)

So far, we have discussed that Saṃdhyāvaṃdanaṃ means doing Suryopāsana at the right time of dawn, mid-day and dusk. We have also learnt a little bit about the sun and understood that all are eligible to worship and meditate on the living manifestion of God, the Surya Bhagavan. However, one should not rush at doing it without proper understanding. Vedic science says, “Jñātvā karmāṇi kurvīta’ (ज्ञात्वा कर्माणि कुर्वीत)” - means any work should be done only after obtaining complete knowledge or wisdom of it.

Śrī Ādi Śaṃkarācārya in his bhāṣyaṃ on Bhagavadgīta, defines Upāsana as follows: 

<div class="shloka">
'Upāsanaṃ nāma yathā śāstramupāsyasya arthanya viṣayī karaṇena sāmīpyamuvagamya taila dhārāvat samāna pratyaya pravāheṇa dīrghakālaṃ yadāsanaṃ tadupāsana mācakṣate- (Gītābhāṣyaṃ2/3) <br/>

'उपासनं नाम यथा शास्त्रमुपास्यस्य अर्थन्य विषयी करणेन सामीप्यमुवगम्य तैल धारावत् समान प्रत्यय प्रवाहेण दीर्घकालं यदासनं तदुपासन माचक्षते- (गीताभाष्यं2/3)<br/>
Meaning: Upasana is to approach the worshipable aspect (God) in accordance with procedure described in Śāstrās and meditate upon it continuously to the best of one’s capacity. 
</div>

Saṃdhyāvaṃdanaṃ may be labeld as ‘The Effort’ we put daily with profound dedication and devotion to reach this stage. This is not at all a difficult task; one needs to spend about 15-20 min each at dawn, mid-day, and dusk. Spending about an hour in a 24-hour cycle will bring great result - Peace of mind. Subsequently, we understand empirically (through observation and experience) that it is nothing but universal welfare (viśva kaḻyāṇaṃ).
