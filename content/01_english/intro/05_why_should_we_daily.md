Our sages have ordered that one should do Saṃdhyāvaṃdanaṃ daily throughout his life without fail - ahāraha saṃdhyāmupāsīta (अहारह संध्यामुपासीत) - means one must perform Saṃdhyāvaṃdanaṃ during three Saṃdhyās, dawn, mid-day, and dusk. What will I get if I do it or what will I lose if I don’t do? If we know the answers, we can decide ourselves whether or not to do Saṃdhyāvaṃdanaṃ or not.

Prakṛti khaṃḍaṃ in Brahma vaivarta purāṇaṃ says - <br/>
Yāvajjīvanaparyaṃtaṃ yastrisaṃdhyaṃ karoti ca| <br/>
sa ca sūryasamo vipraḥ tejasā tapasā sadā॥ <br/>
Tatpādapadmarajasā sadyaḥ pūtā vasuṃdharā| <br/>
jīvanmuktaḥ sa tejasvī saṃdhyāpūto hi dvijaḥ ॥ <br/>
Tīrthāni ca pavitrāṇi tasya sparśanamātrataḥ। <br/>
tataḥ pāpāni yāṃtyeva vainateyādivoragāḥ ॥ <br/><br/><br/>

यावज्जीवनपर्यंतं यस्त्रिसंध्यं करोति च| <br/>स च सूर्यसमो विप्रः तेजसा तपसा सदा॥<br/>
तत्पादपद्मरजसा सद्यः पूता वसुंधरा|<br/> जीवन्मुक्तः स तेजस्वी संध्यापूतो हि द्विजः ॥<br/>
तीर्थानि च पवित्राणि तस्य स्पर्शनमात्रतः। <br/>ततः पापानि यांत्येव वैनतेयादिवोरगाः ॥<br/><br/><br/>

Meaning:  That is, a person who does Saṃdhyāvaṃdanaṃ three times daily throughout his life will glow like a Brahmin who is equivalent to Sun in his brilliance, splendour and penance, i.e. he glows with Brahmatejas (ब्रह्मतेजः). Vasuṃdhara Bhūdevi (Earth’s names) gets sanctified the moment dust particles from his feet touches her. Saṃdhyopāsana makes him utmost pure, sacred and bec. Such a dvijanma Brahman (a Brahman is called as ‘dvijanmuḍu’ after upanayanam) will get liberated from existing state of life while being alive (jīvanmukti) and radiates with brilliance. By his mere touch, i.e., the very moment of his touch, the holy rivers such as Ganga become holier. The way as snakes run away in fear at the sight of Garuda (king of birds), all sins vanish the moment he is seen. Saṃdhyāvaṃdanaṃ is so powerful!

Thus, we can reap the fruits of prosperity, and get brilliance, radiance, effulgence equivalent to that of Sun god by spending just an hour in a 24-hour day.

Hence, suggesting that it is our duty to perform Saṃdhyopāsana to make our human birth meaningful and fruitful, I have attempted to bring this book in line with the tradition and principles laid down by our Rishis based on the knowledge I aquired from the blessings of my gurus.
