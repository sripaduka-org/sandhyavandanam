In the year 1985, I stayed as **"antevasi"** at the home of our guru, [Brahmashree Oruganti Nilakantha Sastri](http://www.sripaduka.org/people/oruganti_nilakantha_shastry/) garu, in Krishna Nagar, Guntur, for about a month. During that period I learned many relevant things, and was also blessed to receive Mantra Diksha from him. He would do trikala sandhyavandana parayana. One day he showed me an old booklet on **“Sarva varṇulaku Sandhyopasana”** - *Sandhyopasana to people of all varnas, without distinction between men and women, and said that women are also eligible to perform sandyopasana*. The book, published in 1953, also contained information related to Sriyagam according to our tradition of [Sri Kalyanananda Bharati](http://www.sripaduka.org/people/kalyanananda_bharati/).

Later, Brahmashree Nori Subrahmanya Shastri, who also belongs to our tradition, printed and distributed 1500 copies of that book on behalf of their trust in 2012, on [Sricharanula](http://www.sripaduka.org/people/kalyanananda_bharati/) birthday.

[Kalyana Sricharanulu](http://www.sripaduka.org/people/kalyanananda_bharati/) is my parama guru. Taking it as an instruction of Jagadguru, keeping his selfless desire of universal welfare as dictum, and applying it to the current world scenario, **"Saṃdhyāvaṃdanaṃ to all"** is being presented to you. I hope everyone will be able to understand this properly and get Guru's blessings.
